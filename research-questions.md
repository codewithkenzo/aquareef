## Search & Query Libraries

### Question: What are the best libraries for implementing search functionality across different data types and platforms?

**Research Status**: Ready for Perplexity Query
**Priority**: High
**Context**: Need to implement search across campaigns, content, analytics, and user data

**Specific Requirements**:
- Full-text search across campaigns and content
- Real-time search suggestions and autocomplete
- Filter and faceted search capabilities
- Performance for large datasets (10k+ campaigns, 100k+ posts)
- Integration with PostgreSQL/SQLite
- TypeScript support
- React/Next.js frontend integration

**Perplexity Query**: "What are the best libraries for search functionality in 2024? Need full-text search, real-time suggestions, faceted search for campaigns and content management. Must integrate with PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Next.js. Compare Elasticsearch, Algolia, MeiliSearch, Fuse.js, and other options for performance and ease of implementation."

**Research Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Research Date**: 2025-01-15

**Key Findings**:

**Top Recommendations**:
1. **MeiliSearch** - Best balance for Next.js/PostgreSQL stack
   - Open-source Rust engine with built-in typo tolerance
   - Official PostgreSQL connector for real-time sync
   - Lightweight SDK with TypeScript support
   - Performance: 1.4s for 100k documents vs Elasticsearch 2.1s
   - Cost: ~$400/mo for 10M documents

2. **Elasticsearch** - Industry standard for complex requirements
   - Mature faceting, BM25 scoring, vector search capabilities
   - Complex cluster management but powerful features
   - Use Logstash for PostgreSQL sync
   - Cost: ~$1,200/mo for 10M documents

3. **Algolia** - Managed service for rapid development
   - Instant search-as-you-type with prebuilt UI components
   - High cost: $2k+/mo for large datasets
   - Limited infrastructure control

**Decision Matrix**:
- Full-Text Relevance: Elasticsearch > MeiliSearch > Algolia > PostgreSQL FTS
- Real-Time Indexing: ✅ All except PostgreSQL FTS
- TypeScript/Next.js Support: All have client SDKs
- Cost Efficiency: PostgreSQL FTS > MeiliSearch > Elasticsearch > Algolia

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Use PostgreSQL logical replication for real-time sync
- Cache frequent queries with Redis
- Deploy search API as edge functions

**Emerging Alternatives**: Typesense (OSS Algolia alternative), Tantivy (Rust Lucene), SingleStore FTS
